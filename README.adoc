= Consumer Driven Contract Testing using Pact

=== An example scenario

Here we have an example describing Pact tests between a consumer (the Billing Service and the User Frontend)
and its provider (the User Service).

=== How to run example
* First of all, you need to start Pact Broker
```bash
cd devops && docker-compose up
```
* Secondly, generate and publish the Billing Service pact consumer contracts to the pact broker
```
mvn clean verify -f billing-service
```
* Then, generate and publish the User Frontend pact consumer contracts to the pact broker
```
cd user-frontend
npm run pact:test &&  npm run pact:publish
```
* Finally, we need to verify those contracts generated by consumer with provider i.e. User Service
```
mvn clean verify -f user-service
```
